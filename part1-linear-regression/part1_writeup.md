# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this lenear regression model?
    > R^2 is the correlation of the x value to the y value, this being 0.625 means that there is a relatively weak yet present correlation between Age and Blood Pressure  
2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person iwho is 43 years old?
    > The predicted blood pressure of someone who is 43 Years old according to the graph would be 137.7.
3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
    > I think that this model's predictions are semi-accurate. I think it will show how blood pressure relatively increases with age but it does not include other factors that could make it more accurate such as if someone smokes or is obese which would cause a higher blood pressure.
