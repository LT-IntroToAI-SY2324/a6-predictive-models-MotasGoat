# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
> By comparing with the training data then using the testing data to make the line of best fit, we are able to get a more accurate line as the outliers become less exaggerated and it makes a more linear or "accurate" line

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
> That there is a semi strong correlation between blood pressure and Age.

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
> I would say that the model is pretty accurate although it tends to be a little lower than the actua Y value.
