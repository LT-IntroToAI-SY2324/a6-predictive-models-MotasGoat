## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.
 > The red group is one I would call "Chronic Shoppers" as they have high spending habits despite their low income. The purple group is one that I would call "Penny Pinchers" which would be due to their low spending habits along with their own annual income. The orange groups is the one that I would call "Average Shoper" as it is the most clustered with medium income and medium spending habits. I would call the green group "Big Spenders" because they have a higher annual income aswell as having high spending scores. The blue  group I would call "Frugal Freddies" as they tend to have a higher annual income but still have low spending scores.  
2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?
> A customer with a medium income and low spending habits would most likely be in the blue group also known as the Frugal Freddies as the person would not be spending that much money but are making a decent amount of money that they would be able to spend.
3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?
> I think that the marketing team could approach the Frugal Freddies with higher incomes that they can use by advertising the qualities of a product and highlighting the value for it's price. This would most likely appreciate the highlights of the value of the product and would have the income and means required to be able to buy few or multiple. If the product is something mass produced, a bulk way of buying would most likely target this demographic
